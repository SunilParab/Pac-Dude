# Pac-Dude

Group Name: Pac Bros
Group Members: Eric Sohel, Sunil Parab

Our project is going to be an enhanced version of Pac-Man called Pac-Dude, with many new features that are not present in the original. We first aim to have a fully functional Pac-Man game similar to the original, which would mean a preset map, the ability for Pac-Man to move around the map and pick up pellets, ghosts with a simple A.I. for deciding how they move around the map, and power pellets which Pac-Dude could eat to then eat the ghosts. After we finish with this we plan to improve the A.I. of the ghosts to make them similar to the original and add randomly generated maps and sound effects. Once we have achieved this we will start to work on additional features to the game, such as keys that can remove walls enclosing the power pellets, traps that can kill Pac-Dude (e.g. spikes that come out of the wall on a timed interval), or more power-ups that would help Pac-Dude clear the level.

Eric Sohel: Created the map class which contains the preset map design along with several methods that allow other classes to interact with it. Also created several methods such as pellet generator which place all the in-game objects on the map.

Eric Sohel: Animated the pellets in the map, and made it so that Pac-Dude could eat these pellets. Also created two new methods which keep track of how many pellets Pac-Dude is eating and worked on creating an end screen for when the player beats the game.
